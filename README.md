# Variational_AutoEncoder
This is part of my internship project I did at BARC.
I have designed a Variational AutoEncoder for reproducing gamma spectrums from a NaTl detector. Dataset is confidential ,thus it is not uploaded here. The basic structure of vae model is uploaded along with it testing on MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
