# Variational_AutoEncoder
This is part of my internship project I did at BARC.
I have designed a Variational AutoEncoder for reproducing gamma spectrums from a NaTl detector. Dataset is confidential ,thus it is not uploaded here. The basic structure of vae model is uploaded along with it testing on MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

The loss plot is attached below
